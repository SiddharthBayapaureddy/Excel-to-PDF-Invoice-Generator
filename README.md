# Excel to PDF -  Invoice Generator

## What is this project?
### This app converts the data in the provided excel files into a PDF as output. Companies use invoices, which contain data on numbers, accounting, products sold, money spent etc., and enter them in excel files. But for sending the invoices to large group of people, or making it public, excel isn't the optimal file type. So this app analyzes the data in the excel sheet, makes a PDF containing the same informating without losing any data, and makes it user-friendly to read it. 
### Instead of making a PDF by hand, it automates the process, and outputs a PDF, based on the format of the excel sheet. The Excel sheet should be of the format as in the invoices folder.

## What did I use?

## Since it's a simple Input/Output App, I didn't provide any GUI for this and it's not necessary as only limited people use it.
